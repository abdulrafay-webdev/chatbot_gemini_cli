This Python application creates a simple and friendly chatbot interface using the Streamlit library. The chatbot works by capturing user input from a text box and then using Python's `subprocess` module to execute a command-line call to the Gemini CLI (`genai prompt`). To ensure the chatbot has a consistent and pleasant demeanor, a prompt strategy is employed where instructions defining a "friendly and helpful AI assistant" personality are prepended to the user's actual message before being sent to the model. The application maintains the conversation history within the current user session using `st.session_state`. As bonus features, a "Clear Chat" button is included to allow the user to reset the conversation at any time, and robust error handling is implemented to gracefully manage any failures during the CLI execution, making the tool more user-friendly.
